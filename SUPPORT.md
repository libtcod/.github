# Support

Any questions for one of my GitHub projects should go to the GitHub Discussions page for that project.
For reporting bugs or requesting features you should use the GitHub Issues page.

For smaller questions or help with a tutorial or project you can ask for help in one of these communites that I take part in:
- The [/c/roguelikedev@programming.dev](https://programming.dev/c/roguelikedev) Lemmy community.
- ``#libtcod`` on the [Libera.â€‹Chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC.
- ``#libtcod`` on the [Roguelikes Discord](https://discord.gg/jEgZtqB).

My [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/HexDecimal) lists my contact information if you need to talk to me directly.
